Objective for Exercise:

This lab introduces you to plotting in R with ggplot and GGally. GGally is an extension of ggplot2

Exercise:

Click in the tiny plus symbol top left and select R Script to create a new R script if you dont have one open already.


We will use the iris dataset. If you don't have it loaded, please copy and paste the following into your R script file.
library(datasets)
data(iris)
In the previous lab, you installed the libraries necessary to create some nice plots let’s execute the following commands:
library(GGally)
ggpairs(iris, mapping=ggplot2::aes(colour = Species))
Select the commands and click on run on the top. You’ll now see the following plot in the plots window: 

Click on Zoom icon on the plot window to zoom and see the plot. 

This gives us a lot of information for a single line of code. First, we see the data distributions per column and species on the diagonal. Then we see all pair-wise scatter plots on the tiles left to the diagonal, again broken down by color. It is, for example, obvious to see that a line can be drawn to separate setosa against versicolor and virginica. In later courses, we’ll of course teach how the overlapping species can be separated as well. This is called supervised machine learning using non-linear classifiers by the way. Then you see the correlation between individual columns in the tiles right to the diagonal which confirms our thoughts that setose is more different, hence more easy to distinguish, than versicolor and virginica since a correlation value close to one signifies high similarity whereas a value closer to zero signifies less similarity. The remaining plots on the right are called box-plots and the ones at the bottom are called histograms bit we won’t go into detail here and save this for a more advanced course in this series.
